The source code for this version of Flash was written in 1997, as a branch off of my console version written in 1991.
I've compiled and run it today on a Windows XP Home SP2 virtual machine on VirtualBox running on Linux Debian 11. The compiler used in Windows was Visual Studio 6.0.

There are screenshots of build and run in the docs folder.

I've attempted to reduce the artifacts checked in to only those needed for build and the final build product but there are a LOT of files many of which I don't recall if Visual Studio generated them as  part of my original work or if I made them manually or if they are even necessary. Leaving in those I'm not sure about.

Very suprisingly, the build under Release here also works on (an actual :) Windows 10 running on my old 64-bit Dell Optiplex 780 with one very important exception in that the Help dialogs do not work on Windows 10. Apparently Microsoft wants developers to provide that feature some other way now which is unfortunate as the Help docs I wrote were quite detailed and I think .... helpful.
