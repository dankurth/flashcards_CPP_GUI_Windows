This program was developed as a study aid. It works like flash cards but
with the added advantage that it keeps track of which cards you have
problems with and shows only those cards. Cards that are answered
correctly the first time are marked and are not shown again until
cleared by the user. Those that are answered incorrectly are reshown at
random until they are answered correctly, and they will reappear in new
sessions until they are answered right the first time in any of those
sessions.

You can use the cards provided or you can make up your own to study
anything that can be put on flash cards. When you miss a question you
will be shown the correct answer. The computer will keep track of your
progress and show you your score. In studying the cards you can use
multiple choice or the honor system.

This version started off in 1997 as a branch from a DOS/Linux console mode version
that I'd first written around 1991.

It was built using Visual Studio 6.0 Professional, most recently on a virtualBox Windows XP.

Unlike the console version it does not run on Linux, but does have a built in feature
to create and edit cards (said files have extension .FSF for Flash Study File).

It also runs on my 64-bit Windows 10 machine, but currently the Help functionality is
broken for that that and (I presume) later versions of Windows.
